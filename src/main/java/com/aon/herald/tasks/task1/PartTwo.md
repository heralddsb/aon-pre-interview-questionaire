## Approach for Measuring Timing Across the Application

To efficiently measure method execution time in multiple places, the best approach is to use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) or similar techniques. Hereâ€™s how it can be designed:

Design Using AOP

1. Aspect for Timing Logic:
- Create an aspect that intercepts method calls across the application.
- The aspect captures the start and end times of each method and logs the duration.

2. Scalability:
- AOP eliminates the need to manually add timing code to each method, ensuring consistency across the application.

3. Implementation Example (Using Spring AOP):

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class MethodTimingAspect {
    @Around("execution(* com.example..*(..))")
    public Object logExecutionTime(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Object result = joinPoint.proceed(); // Execute the target method
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        System.out.println(joinPoint.getSignature() + " executed in " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");
        return result;
    }
}
```

Benefits of This Approach
1. <b>Centralized Timing Logic</b>: Timing is managed in one place, reducing code duplication.

2. <b>Non-Intrusive</b>: No changes are needed in the core implementation of methods.

3. <b>Scalable</b>: Can target specific classes, methods, or packages using pointcuts.
