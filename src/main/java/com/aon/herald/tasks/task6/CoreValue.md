# Core Value

As a software engineer, I value working collaboratively, maintaining standards in my work, and taking accountability to contribute to team success.

Here’s a refined list that aligns with my background and aspirations:

- Collaboration and Teamwork
- Ownership and Accountability
- Continuous Learning and Improvement
- Customer-Centric Approach
- Adaptability and Resilience

These values matter because they help me create a good team vibe where everyone can count on each other. Taking ownership shows I’m reliable, while adaptability helps me roll with changes and challenges. Integrity and trust keep relationships solid and make sure everyone’s on the same page. Together, they make work smoother, more productive, and meaningful.
